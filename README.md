# Would They Play?

Used statistical modeling, data mining, web scraping &amp; APIs to create a Python app that determines the likelihood of an artist playing a popular music festival (Vans Warped Tour). Integrated data from Spotify, Last.FM, Musicbrainz, Gracenote, Songkick, iTunes, Amazon, and Billboard.



Created a GUI. Uploaded to Heroku using Flask.
